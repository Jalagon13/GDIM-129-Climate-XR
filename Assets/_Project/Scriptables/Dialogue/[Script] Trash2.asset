  ItemName: Bamboo Toothbrush
  DialogueScript:
  - Golly gosh. I love bamboo.
  - "Hmmm, but I\u2019m not sure if it beats sunflowers as my favorite plant, though."
  - "What\u2019s cooler? Bein\u2019 the fastest growin\u2019 plant or turnin\u2019
    direction to follow the sun?"
  - "I\u2019ll just say they\u2019re both equally as cool. And equally my favorite."
  - "Can yuh\u2019 guess the speed of the fastest growing species of bamboo?"
  - "I bet a dime you can\u2019t."
  - "IT\u2019S 3 FEET PER DAY!"
  - "I still can\u2019t imagine that."
  - 'And no wonder those pandas are so fat. '
  - 'If my favorite snack grew that fast, I would be just as fat. '
  - "\u2026"
  - Okay, I am just as fat. Heh heh
  - Anyway, this here bamboo toothbrush is much better than those old plastic ones.
  - "Since it\u2019s made from a plant, you can just toss it in the compost or green
    waste bin."
  - "Just be careful \u2018cause if you toss it in the regular ole\u2019 trash can,
    it\u2019ll make some nasty methane while decomposin\u2019."
  - "And methane is a gas that\u2019s warmin\u2019 our lovely Earth."
  - Our lovely, beautiful Earth.
