  DialogueScript:
  - "Is that\u2026 extruded polystyrene foam\u2026?"
  - "I heckn\u2019 hate extruded polystyrene foam!"
  - "Oh, yeah, it\u2019s also typically called Styrofoam."
  - "Fun fact, Styrofoam is the brand name of extruded polystyrene foam. Just like
    how Velcro is the brand name for the \u201Chook and loop\u201D."
  - "Who\u2019s gonna call it a \u201Chook and loop\u201D? HEH, HEH."
  - "Was that fun fact \u2026 fun, bud?"
  - Well, one of these days my fun fact will be fun.
  - "It\u2019s just hard when we\u2019re talking about extruded polystyrene foam."
  - "Sad fact! Extruded polystyrene foam leaches toxic chemicals into water and food
    when it\u2019s heated!"
  - "And it\u2019s not recyclable in most areas! HEH, HEH."
  - "Oh no, my angry laughs are comin\u2019 back."
  - I only get those when I talk about extruded polystyrene foam!
  - "Let\u2019s catch another piece a\u2019 junk before I get another bout of them."
