  DialogueScript:
  - You caught it! Nice one, bud!
  - "That\u2019s a nice piece-a junk you caught there, bud!"
  - "That\u2019s a mighty fine rubber boot you got there! I don\u2019t know who would
    wanna throw that away!"
  - Huh, you seem disappointed?
  - "Oh, uhhh\u2026"
  - "I\u2019m sorry if I forgot to tell you, but\u2026 "
  - "This pond here doesn\u2019t have no fish in it."
  - Not for a long while, at least.
  - With all this junk here, it made it inhospitable for any life.
  - "But you know, now that I got an extra helping hand around\u2013and some darn
    good company\u2013I think we can clean this place up, one rubber boot at a time!"
  - Go on then! Cast your rod out again and let's see what we can find!
