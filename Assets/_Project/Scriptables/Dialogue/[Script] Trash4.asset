  ItemName: Metal Food Tin
  DialogueScript:
  - That looks like a little food tin!
  - I love tins.
  - They come in all shapes and sizes. Can be used for all sorts of things.
  - "My ma\u2019 would collect all of the Christmas popcorn tins and store her yarn
    in them."
  - "I use one to hold my lil\u2019 tuna fish sandwich every day."
  - "Why would I put my lil\u2019 tuna fish sandwich in a plastic baggie?"
  - "I treat my lil\u2019 tuna fish sandwiches with respect."
  - Until I get hungry, that is.
  - "Neat thing is, when a tin gets a bit too beat up or rusted, you could just toss
    it in the recyclin\u2019 and turn it into somethin\u2019 new."
  - "Only learned that you can typically recycle rusty metal once I started workin\u2019
    at the ole\u2019 recyclin\u2019 plant back in my youthful days."
  - 'Oh, and unlike plastic, with metal you can recycle it forever. It never breaks
    down! '
  - I love how you can turn a sad scrap of metal into a new beautiful Christmas popcorn
    tin.
  - "Let\u2019s cast another one out! I hope we get a Christmas popcorn tin next!"
